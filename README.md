# StudyTimer
==============================

Function
------------
You can measure how much time you spend for each activities and based on the activity you will get the reward.
You can see the detailed log for each day and see how much money you make for each day in graph.

Motivation
------------
I found that it is sometimes difficult to motivate myself to the tasks if they are so boring like homework??
I love money and I found that I am so motivated if I have some achievement while I am doing boring stuff. 
I found one of the good motivation is money! It is a virtual money, but I am going to add more functions.
